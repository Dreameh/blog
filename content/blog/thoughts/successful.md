The word successful is a word I frequently hear with the word money,
but is it money that makes you successful?

The definition of successful on Cambridge dictionary shows:
### [Successful](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/successful)
> (B1)
>
> [achieving](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/achieve "achieving") the [results](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/result "results") [wanted](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/wanted "wanted") or [hoped](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hope "hoped") for:
> - a successful [operation](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/operation "operation")

> (B2)
>
> having [achieved](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/achieve "achieved") a lot, [become](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/become "become") [popular](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/popular "popular"), and/or made a lot of [money](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/money "money"):
> - a successful [career](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/career "career")
> - She [runs](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/run "runs") a very successful [computer](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/computer "computer") [business](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/business "business").
> - He's the [author](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/author "author") of several [hugely](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/huge "hugely") successful children's [books](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/books "books") (= [books](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/books "books") which have been [bought](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bought "bought") by a lot of [people](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/people "people")).

So yes, in terms of definition, the word successful ultimately means that if you have a lot of money, or you have a successful career, which in turn also would mean a lot of money, then you are by definition successful...

But what if I want to change the meaning of the word successful to become something like being succeed as an individual and therefore being you are successful, is that alright?

Here's my reasoning behind my thinking, I have for the past 26 years of my life heard that you need a lot of money to be happy because if you don't have the big boi millions or a big house with 15 children, can you truly be happy as an individual? Can you be content with having a salary that is just enough to put food on your table, a roof over your head and you being able to enjoy yourself with new things from time to time, is that enough?

That is what I have always thought would be the best way to enjoy life, just having enough, however, the general surrounding does not agree with me, the social media does not agree with me, my parents don't agree with me, my friends doesn't agree with me, why?

I have been thinking about it a lot and it all has to do with the word content.

### [Content](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/content)
> (B2)
>
> [pleased](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pleased "pleased") with [your](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/your "your") [situation](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/situation "situation") and not [hoping](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hope "hoping") for [change](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/change "change") or [improvement](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/improvement "improvement"):
> - He [seems](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/seem "seems") [fairly](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fairly "fairly") content with (his) [life](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/life "life").
> - They're content to [socialize](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/socialize "socialize") with a very [small](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/small "small") [circle](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/circle "circle") of [people](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/people "people").

In this world of social media, we often see how the filthy rich lives, and we often see those around us in a different light, only because that's the way it's supposed to look. Many who posts things on the social media often portray their life as extravagant even if it's not even remotely close to extravagant, that's the fun part about social media as everything no matter how mundane your life is, can look pretty nice if you apply the right filter, the right scenario and the right object. 

This would suggest that we would have to show a third word and it's definition.
### [Comparison](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/comparison)
> (B2)
>
>  the [act](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/act "act") of [comparing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/compare "comparing") two or more [people](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/people "people") or things:
> - They made a comparison of different [countries](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/country "countries")' [eating](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eat "eating") [habits](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/habit "habits").
> - By/In comparison with the [French](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/french "French"), the British [eat](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/eat "eat") [far](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/far "far") less [fish](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fish "fish").

In this day and age, we surely love to compare ourselves against one and another because, the measure of wealth, success, looks and so forth is a good guideline for how to do a comparison, but shouldn't we measure how content we are instead? Shouldn't we just not have a dick measuring contest and just be our self for the reason that we like the situation we are in?

My list of being content is like this:
> - Not having debt
> - having enough money for food and shelter
> - Living healthy and strong
> - Having a good relationship with friends and a loved one
> - Being in a country which I feel is good enough
> - Working with something I enjoy working with

# Conclusion
We shouldn't have to compare ourselves with others, because nothing good will come out of that, instead, making sure that you can be the best version of yourself that you can be, is certainly the way to go, and it should also be the very thing you should strive for in life.
