I wish that this blog will be a place that will transform my own thoughts and ideas to words that
I can make sense of, and others, although I must say, I am not really the best writer, so a plus
would be that such skills would become better, only time will tell.

This blog will serve as a insight of all things I enjoy, things I am curious about and things I don't understand.
It's gonna be something along the lines of I teach myself while perhaps teaching others?

Sounds good? Perfect.

## About myself

Let's go through the hardest part to explain, that being myself.

I am a 26 year old boy with a burning passion for everything that interests me, which is why I
am currently studying Information Technology, I live in the land where there are over a thousand
lakes, a fun amount of bears and atleast one sauna per household while boasting the biggest
coffee drinking population in the world.

For the last ten years I have been:

-   Distro hopping like a madman
-   Learning languages for both computers and people
-   Increasing my knowledge of technology +1 at the time
-   Traveling a little bit to get the feel of what it's like to live somewhere else.
-   Getting to know interesting people all over the world
-   Trying my best to be a grillmaster during the summer
-   Trying out some different fields before actually deciding on programming
-   At one point almost became a ships electrician

Trying out new technologies and increasing my knowledge of everything tech by a whooping +1 at the
time this year while blogging about it shall be a goal, and while it's not really the first of january,
I can still make due of what I have.
